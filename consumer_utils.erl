%% Helpful functions that simplify communication with UDP protocol.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Function: read
%% Purpose: Reads data send using UDP protocol on a given port for given amount of milliseconds.
%% Arguments: Port and amount of milliseconds to wait.
%% Returns: Tuple {SenderAddress, SenderPort, Data} or {}
%%     if error has occurred or no data has been read.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Function: read
%% Purpose: Reads data send using UDP protocol on a given port for 1000 milliseconds.

%% Function: recv
%% Purpose: Reads data send using UDP protocol on a given socket for given amount of milliseconds.
%% Arguments: Socket and amount of milliseconds to wait.
%% Returns: Tuple {SenderAddress, SenderPort, Data} or {}
